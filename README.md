callgraphjs
-----------

Approximate call graph construction for JavaScript, based on the algorithm in [this paper](http://cs.au.dk/~asf/icse13-callgraphs.pdf).

This implementation is intended for demonstration and reference purposes.

It also serves as an example of how to use [parsejs](https://github.com/asgerf/parsejs.dart).
